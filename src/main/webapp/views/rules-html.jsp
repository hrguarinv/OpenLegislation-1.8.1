    ß  5. Special orders. Whenever any bill or other matter is made a special
  order for a particular day, and it shall not be completed on that  day,  it
  shall, unless otherwise ordered, retain its place on the calendar as a spe-
  cial order in the order of business in which it was considered. When a spe-
  cial  order  is under consideration, it shall take precedence over any spe-
  cial order for a subsequent hour of the same day; but such subsequent order
  may be taken up immediately after disposal of the previous special order.

  part of the  calendar  designated  as  "order  of  special  report,"  bills
  reported from a standing committee shall be placed on the first report cal-
  endar  and,  unless  starred, shall be automatically advanced to the second
  report part of the calendar after one calendar legislative day.   Bills  on
  second  report  shall,  unless  starred,  be advanced to the order of third
  reading after one calendar legislative day. No debate shall be  allowed  on
  the  advancement of bills on the order of first or second report or special
  report. The order of special report shall be marked  with  an  asterisk  to
  indicate  that  such  bills  will be subject to debate on the next calendar
  legislative day. In the event that such bills are not debated on such  day,
  they  shall  be removed from the order of special report and placed on that
  part of the calendar designated "bills on order of first report".
 
    ß 7. Executive Session. The Senate shall go into consideration of  execu-
  tive  business at such times as may be ordered by a vote of the majority of
  the Senators present. On motion to close the doors of the  Senate,  on  the
 
 
  discussion  of  business  which  in  the opinion of any Senator may require
  secrecy, and during the consideration of all business in executive session,
  the Presiding Officer shall direct all persons, except  the  Senators,  the
  Counsel to the Majority, the Counsel to the Minority, Secretary of the Sen-
  ate,  his  or  her messenger, the Journal Clerk and Sergeant at Arms of the
  Senate to withdraw; and during the discussion  of  said  motion  the  doors
  shall  remain  shut; and every Senator and officer of the Senate shall keep
  secret all such matters, proceedings and things which shall transpire while
  the doors remain closed.
 
    ß 8. Motions. a. When a question is before the Senate, only the following
  motions shall be made by a Senator, and such motions shall have  precedence
  in the order here stated, viz.:
 
    (1) For an adjournment.
 
    (2) For a call of the Senate.
 
    (3) For the previous question.
 
    (4) To lay on the table.
 
    (5) To postpone to a certain day.
 
    (6) To commit to a standing committee.
 
    (7) To commit to a select committee.
 
    (8) To change calendar arrangement.
 
    (9) To amend.
 
    b.  The motion to adjourn, or for a call of the Senate, or for the previ-
  ous question, or to lay on the table, shall be decided without debate,  and

    c.  Except  for the motions enumerated in subdivision a hereof, all other
  motions shall be reduced to writing, if desired by the Presiding Officer or
  any five Senators, delivered to the Secretary, and  read  before  the  same
  shall  be debated; and any motion may be withdrawn at any time before deci-
  sion or amendment.
 
    d. A motion for the previous question, or a motion to postpone to a  cer-
  tain  day,  or to commit, or refer to a standing or select committee, until
  it is decided, shall preclude all debate of the main question.
 
    e. A motion for the previous question shall only be in order when made by
  the Temporary President, the Minority Leader or their designee. The "previ-
  ous question" shall be put as follows: "Shall the main question now be  put
  before  the  house?" and until it is decided, shall preclude all amendments
  or debate. When, on taking the previous question, the Senate  shall  decide
  that  the main question shall now be put, the main question shall be put to
  an immediate vote. When, on taking the previous question, the Senate  shall
  decide that the main question shall not now be put, the main question shall
  be considered as still remaining under debate. The "main question" shall be
 
 
  the  advancement  or  passage of the bill, resolution or other matter under
  consideration. Such motion shall require the affirmative vote of a majority
  of the Senators elected.
 
    ß  9.  Reconsideration. a. When a question has once been put and decided,
  it shall be in order for any Senator to move for the reconsideration there-
  of; but no motion for the reconsideration of any vote  shall  be  in  order
  after  the  bill,  resolution,  message,  report,  amendment, nomination or
  motion, upon which the vote was taken, shall have  gone  out  of  the  pos-
  session of the Senate; nor shall any motion for reconsideration be in order
  unless made on the same day on which the vote was taken, or within the next
  three  days  of  the actual session of the Senate thereafter. Nor shall any
  question be reconsidered more than once; but  when  a  bill  or  resolution
  shall  have  been  recalled from the Assembly, a motion for reconsideration
  may be made at any time thereafter while the same is in the  possession  of
  the  Senate,  and  all  resolutions recalling a bill or resolution from the
  Assembly shall be regarded as privileged. No  vote  shall  be  reconsidered
  upon either of the following motions:
 
    To adjourn.
 
    To lay on the table.
 
    b. The vote on the final passage of any bill appropriating moneys or pro-
  perty,  or  creating,  continuing, altering or removing any body politic or
  corporate, shall not be reconsidered whenever any such bill shall be  lost,
  unless  by  a vote of a majority of all the Senators elected, but all other
  bills, when the same shall have been lost, may be reconsidered by a vote of
  a majority of all the Senators present and voting.
 
 
                                    RULE VI
 
  INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS
 
    Section  1.  Introduction. Bills and resolutions shall be introduced by a
  Senator, or on the report of a committee, or by message from the  Assembly,
  or  by  order  of the Senate, or by the Governor pursuant to Article VII of
  the Constitution. Every bill introduced shall be  in  duplicate  and  shall
  have  endorsed thereon a title and the name of the bill's sponsor and shall
  be accompanied by the introducer's memorandum in quadruplicate. Such  memo-
  randum  shall  contain  a  statement of the purposes and intent of the bill
  and, if the member deems it appropriate, may set forth  such  other  state-
  ments that the member feels necessary including, but not limited to, state-
  ments  relating  to  economic impact, environmental impact or the impact on
  the judicial system of the bill. A Committee, where it deems necessary, may
  require that the introducer's memorandum be amended to include such  appro-
  priate statements.
 
    Bills  introduced  by Senators shall be deposited with the Revision Clerk
  for the purpose of having such clerk examine and  correct  bills  to  avoid
  repetition  of introduction and ensure accuracy in the text and references.
  Upon introduction, each bill shall be deemed to have had its first and sec-
  ond reading, unless otherwise ordered and shall be given a number and imme-
  diately referred to the appropriate standing  committee  by  the  Temporary
  President or an officer designated by the Temporary President in accordance
  with  a  set of guidelines to be published annually by the Temporary Presi-
  dent setting forth the respective statutes over which each of the  standing
  committees shall have subject matter jurisdiction for purposes of referral.
  Such  referrals shall reflect the subject matter having predominance in the
  bill as determined by the Temporary President.
 
    ß 2. Multi-sponsorship. Any Senator may join together in the  multi-spon-
  sorship  of  a  bill.  If two or more Senators join together when a bill is
  first introduced and before it is printed, the names of all  multi-sponsors
  shall appear on the printed bill upon the following conditions:
 
    a.  Multi-sponsors  shall  file  a written request in duplicate to act as
  such, on forms provided, with the Revision Clerk of the Senate.  The  first
  name  appearing  on  the bill shall be deemed the introducer and all others
  deemed multi-sponsors.
 
    b. The introducer shall at all times retain exclusive control of the bill
  until formally acted upon by the Senate and any motion to discharge a  bill
  out of committee by a member who is not the introducer of the bill shall be
  out of order.
 
    c.  After  a  multi-sponsored  bill  has  been printed, any multi-sponsor
  desiring to withdraw from  such  multi-sponsorship  shall  file  a  written
  request  on  a  form provided so that his or her name will be stricken as a
  multi-sponsor from the records of the Revision  Clerk.  The  printed  bill,
  however, shall not be reprinted.
 
 
    d.  Senators  and  Senators-elect  may multi-sponsor bills that have been
  pre-filed and bills introduced after the opening of each  legislative  ses-
  sion upon the following conditions:
 
    (1)  After  a bill has been introduced and printed and before it has been
  reported favorably out of the Committee to which it was referred, any  Sen-
  ator  or Senators may file with the Revision Clerk a request on a form pro-
  vided to become a multi-sponsor of such bill. Such forms must be signed  by
  the multi-sponsor.
 
    (2)  Such bill shall not be reprinted solely for the purpose of adding or
  deleting names of multi-sponsors.
 
    (3) Any Senator, having become a multi-sponsor of a  bill,  may  withdraw
  from  such  by  filing  a  request on a form provided to the Revision Clerk
  requesting that his or her name be stricken as  a  multi-sponsor  from  the
  record.
 
    (4)  Any  Senator  who has become a multi-sponsor of a bill in the manner
  set forth herein shall have the right to distribute such  bill  bearing  an
  endorsement by rubber stamp or otherwise the words "multi-sponsored by" and
  insert his or her own name as multi-sponsor.
 
    ß  3.  Printing.  Every  bill  immediately upon its introduction shall be
  printed and placed on the bill files on the desks of the Senators, where it
  shall remain for at  least  three  calendar  legislative  days.  All  bills
  reported  favorably  or for consideration, if reported with amendments, and
  all bills amended in the Senate, shall be immediately printed, except  that
  any  bill which is amended by restoring it to an earlier form, shall not be
  required to be printed again, and thereafter the printed number of the bill
  in the form to which it has been so restored  shall  constitute  the  final
  form  of  such bill unless further amended.  Whenever a bill is amended and
  printed, a letter of the alphabet starting with "A" shall be added  to  its
  number.
 
    ß  4. Title and body of bill. The title of every bill shall briefly state
  the subject thereof. The title of every bill amending or repealing any pro-
  vision of a consolidated law shall refer to such law. The  title  of  every
  bill  amending  or repealing any unconsolidated law shall refer to such law
  by its short title, if it has one; if it has no short title, the  title  of
  such  bill  shall  state the chapter number, year of enactment and the com-
  plete title of the original bill or a short summary of  the  provisions  to
  which  the  law  relates.  If such bill is amending or repealing a proposed
  provision of law contained in a bill that has not been  enacted  into  law,
  the  title  shall state the number of the bill containing the proposed pro-
  vision of law to be amended or repealed, with suffix, if there be one,  and
  the subject of the provisions to which the amendatory bill relates. No pri-
  vate  or local bill may be passed which shall embrace more than one subject
  which shall be expressed in the title.
 
    a. In any bill, each section proposing an amendment to or the repeal  of:
  (i)  any  consolidated  law,  or any part thereof; or (ii) the Family Court
  Act, the Court of Claims Act, the Uniform District Court Act,  the  Uniform
  Justice  Court  Act, the Uniform City Court Act, the New York City Charter,
  the Administrative Code of the City of New York, the New  York  City  Civil
 
 
  Court Act, the New York City Criminal Court Act, or the Charter of the City
  of  Buffalo,  or  any part thereof shall refer to such law, act, charter or
  code. In any bill, each section proposing an amendment to or the repeal  of
  an  unconsolidated  law  having  a  short title, or any part thereof, shall
  refer to such law by its chapter number and year of enactment and its short
  title. If an unconsolidated law shall have no  short  title,  each  section
  shall  state  the  chapter  number and year of enactment of such law, and a
  short summary of the provisions to which the law relates  or  the  complete
  title  of  the  original bill. If such section amends or repeals a proposed
  provision of law contained in a bill that has not been  enacted  into  law,
  each  section  shall  state the number of the bill containing such proposed
  provisions of law to be amended or repealed, with suffix, if there be  one.
  If the portion of the law proposed to be amended has been added, renumbered
  or amended since the original enactment or last general revision of the law
  of which it is a part, such section shall also state the chapter number and
  year  of the last act adding, renumbering or amending the same, as the case
  may be. There shall be appended at the end of every bill which proposes the
  repeal or extension of any existing law, or part thereof, merely by  refer-
  ence  thereto,  without setting forth the text thereof, an explanatory note
  which shall briefly and concisely state the subject matter of the  law,  or
  part thereof, proposed to be repealed or extended, unless such subject mat-
  ter  is  stated in the title of such bill. The Revision Clerk of the Senate
  shall return any bill to the Senator introducing the same when it is called
  to his or her attention that the provisions of this section, or of  section
  one  of  this Rule, have not been complied with, or when any copy of a bill
  is illegible or incomplete.
 
    b. Every bill when introduced, and every  amendment  thereafter  made  to
  such  bill amending existing law, must have all new matter underscored, and
  all matter eliminated by amendment from existing law  must  appear  in  its
  proper  place  enclosed  in  brackets.  In the printed bill such new matter
  shall be underscored and all matter eliminated by amendment  from  existing
  law  shall  be  enclosed  in black-faced brackets. When any existing law or
  part thereof is proposed to be repealed by a bill, the word  "repealed"  as
  it appears in such bill shall be printed in bold-faced type. When a printed
  bill is amended by eliminating new matter from such bill, the same shall be
  omitted  in  the  reprint of the original. When amendments are offered to a
  printed bill, the proposed changes, indicating page and line numbers, shall
  be listed on four detail sheets and the same changes shall be  incorporated
  and  marked on two copies of the bill; provided, however, that no amendment
  shall be allowed to any bill which is not germane to the original object or
  purpose thereof. Furthermore, when a printed bill is amended the accompany-
  ing introducer's memorandum, required pursuant to section one of this Rule,
  shall also be amended to reflect any changes. It shall be the duty  of  the
  Secretary  to  direct the Revision Clerk to cause any bill appearing on the
  calendar and not complying with this section to be immediately amended  and
  printed so as to comply with the same.
 
    ß 5. Final date. a. The Temporary President may designate a date in writ-
  ing  after  which no bill or original resolution shall be introduced except
  by message from the Assembly, but no date prior to  the  first  Tuesday  of
  March shall be so designated; provided, however, that all bills recommended
  by a State department or agency must be submitted to the office of the Tem-
  porary  President  not later than the first day of March. Bills proposed by
  the Governor, the Attorney General, the Comptroller, the Department of Edu-
 
 
  cation or the Office of Court  Administration  must  be  submitted  to  the
  office of the Temporary President no later than the first Tuesday in April.
 
    b.  All  bills  introduced  in the Senate after the second Friday in June
  shall be introduced to the Committee on Rules.
 
    ß 6. Budget bills. When a bill is submitted or proposed by  the  Governor
  by  authority  of Article VII of the Constitution, it shall become, for all
  legislative purposes, a legislative bill, and upon receipt thereof  by  the
  Senate it shall be endorsed "Budget Bill" and be given a number by the Sec-
  retary  and  shall  be  referred  to  the Finance Committee and be printed.
  Budget bills may be reported from the Finance Committee direct to the third
  reading calendar.
 
    ß 7. Program, departmental and agency bills. Every bill proposed  by  the
  Governor, the Attorney General, the Comptroller or by state departments and
  agencies  shall  be  submitted to the office of the Temporary President and
  shall be forwarded for introduction purposes to  the  appropriate  standing
  committee in accordance with section one of Rule VI. Any such bill which is
  not  so  forwarded within three weeks after receipt by the Temporary Presi-
  dent shall be offered by the office  of  the  Temporary  President  to  the
  Minority  Leader who may in accordance with section one of Rule VI, forward
  such bills to any member for introduction purposes.
 
    ß 8. Reintroduction. Any Senate bill introduced in the first year of  the
  term  of  the  Senate which during that regular Legislative Session was not
  reported from a Standing Committee or if reported and later recommitted  to
  a  Standing  Committee  is  deemed to be automatically reintroduced for the
  second year of the term of the Senate. All bills which remain on the calen-
  dar at the end of the first year of the term of the Senate shall be  recom-
  mitted to committee.
 
    ß  9. Resolutions. a. All original resolutions shall be in quadruplicate,
  and no original resolution may be introduced unless  copies  thereof  first
  shall have been furnished forty-eight hours prior to the time for acting on
  such  resolution to the Temporary President and Minority Leader. All resol-
  utions, upon introduction, shall be referred to a standing or  select  com-
  mittee by the Temporary President or an officer designated by the Temporary
  President and shall at all times remain within the exclusive control of the
  introducer.  Notwithstanding  any  of the foregoing provisions of this sec-
  tion, resolutions recalling bills from or returning bills to the  Assembly,
  or  relating  to  adjournment,  may be introduced at any time for immediate
  consideration.
 
    b. A resolution supporting or condemning, or proposing or urging a change
  in Federal law which is not directly  germane  to  the  affairs,  business,
  rights,  benefits  and  obligations of New York State shall be out of order
  and shall not be reported and any resolution recommending, urging, support-
  ing, altering or condemning a position or change in foreign policy  of  the
  United  States  Government  or the domestic or foreign affairs of any other
  government of the World shall be out of order and shall not be reported.
 
    c. All resolutions which propose any amendment to the State  Constitution
  shall be referred to the Attorney General as provided in Article XIX of the
  Constitution,  and shall be treated in the same form of proceedings as that
 
 
  provided for bills; and resolutions which ratify any proposed amendment  to
  the  Constitution of the United States shall be treated in the same form of
  proceedings as provided for bills. After a resolution to  amend  the  State
  Constitution  shall  be  advanced  to third reading, no motion to amend the
  same shall be in order without unanimous consent; and if such resolution to
  amend the State Constitution shall be amended  after  the  opinion  of  the
  Attorney  General  thereon  has been received as provided in Article XIX of
  the Constitution, it shall again be referred to the Attorney  General.  Any
  such resolution may be committed prior to the final reading thereof.
 
    d.  All resolutions calling for the expenditure of moneys must be decided
  by a majority vote of all of the members elected to the Senate, upon a call
  of the roll.
 
    e. All resolutions other than those mentioned and treated in the  preced-
  ing  subdivisions  c and d of this section and reported by the committee of
  reference designated by the Temporary President shall be  placed  upon  the
  calendar.  When  in  the order of business the resolutions are reached, the
  Senate may adopt such resolutions as a group, by one vote upon the question
  of the entire calendar of resolution, excepting that any member may request
  that any one or more of the resolutions on such  calendar  shall  be  voted
  upon  or debated separately. This subdivision shall not apply to any resol-
  ution recalling bills from or returning bills to the Assembly, or  relating
  to  adjournment  or to resolutions pertaining to the rules of the Senate or
  to those resolutions regarded as privileged.

  Majority Leader for Legislative Operations and the Minority Leader and Dep-
  uty Minority Leader shall be nonvoting ex-officio members of  all  standing
  committees  of  the  Senate of which they are not actual members. As far as
  practicable, Senators shall be appointed to no  more  than  seven  standing
  committees.
 
    b. Term limits for chairs and ranking members. No chair or ranking member
  of  a  committee shall serve in such capacity longer than eight consecutive
  years.
 
 
    c. Conference membership of committees. The membership of all committees,
  unless otherwise provided by the act or resolution creating them, shall  be
  composed,  as  nearly  as may be, of majority and minority party members in
  the same proportion as the number of majority and minority party members in
  the  Senate  bears  to  the total membership of the Senate. For purposes of
  committee composition, in the event that the proportion of majority members
  would result in a fractional amount, the number of majority  members  shall
  be rounded up to the next whole number.  The membership of the Finance Com-
  mittee  and the Rules Committee shall be the proportion of majority members
  in the Senate plus an additional five percent. Further, in the case  of  an
  excused  absence of any committee member on either the Finance or the Rules
  Committee, the Temporary President of the Senate or the Minority Leader may
  designate an alternate member of the conference for  meetings  of  standing
  committees  provided written notice is provided and accepted by the counsel
  to the majority conference at least one hour prior to the  commencement  of
  such committee meeting.
 
    ß  2.  Committee on Rules. The Committee on Rules may sit at any time and
  shall report bills out of committee only  if  they  shall  have  been  duly
  reported  to the Committee on Rules from a standing committee of origin, or
  from a committee of secondary reference, or if the chair of  such  standing
  committee  consents,  or if the bill was referred to the Committee on Rules
  upon introduction. Other than a motion to hold, a motion to discharge, or a
  motion to report, no other motion shall be in order  in  the  Committee  on
  Rules without the consent of the Committee Chair. The reception and consid-
  eration  of  its  report  shall  always be in order; debate on its adoption
  shall not exceed one hour, one-half hour for  and  one-half  hour  against,
  such  time  to  be allotted by the Temporary President and Minority Leader;
  and no other motion, except a motion by the Temporary President for a  call
  of the Senate, to adjourn or to recess, shall be in order until the vote of
  the  Senate  is  had  thereon.   If the report be adopted, all inconsistent
  rules of the Senate shall automatically be suspended until the  subject  of
  such report has been disposed of, including final action thereon.
 
    ß  3.  Open  Meetings  of Standing Committees. a. (1) Standing committees
  shall hold regular meetings at such time and on such day  as  scheduled  by
  the  Deputy Majority Leader for Legislative Operations in consultation with
  the chair and such schedule shall be published one week in advance  of  the
  date of such meeting and shall be posted on the Senate committee board. The
  attendance  of the members of the committee shall be recorded at each meet-
  ing, and a copy of such report shall be filed with the Journal Clerk of the
  Senate and made available to the public. Each chair of a standing committee
  shall, no later than 3 p.m. the Thursday  preceding  the  regular  meeting,
  furnish  to the Temporary President and Minority Leader, and make available
  to each member of such committee, a copy of  the  agenda  of  such  regular
  meeting  together  with a copy of the introducer's memorandum for each bill
  listed on such agenda for such regular meeting. In addition, copies of such
  agenda for such regular meeting shall be made available to  representatives
  of the news media and to the general public. However, in case of necessity,
  the  chair  with  consent  of  the ranking member may add no more than four
  items on the agenda or delete items on the agenda up to 24 hours in advance
  of the scheduled meeting and members shall be notified of such additions or
  deletions. Each standing committee chair shall decide all procedural issues
  which arise during meetings of standing committees.
 
 
    (2) Standing committees may hold special meetings in  case  of  necessity
  upon  the  call  of  the chair when the announcement is made from the floor
  during session, or the ranking minority member of  the  committee  consents
  thereto,  or  upon the call of a majority of all the members thereof, entry
  of  which  fact shall be made on the records of the committee and announced
  by the Secretary of the Senate.
 
    (3) All meetings of committees shall  be  open  to  authorized  represen-
  tatives of the news media and the general public as observers.
 
    (4)  All  meetings  of  committees  shall be recorded by video and to the
  extent practicable webcast live. Video of all committee meetings  shall  be
  made available on the Senate website and updated daily.
 
    (5)  Upon the personal vote of a majority of all the members of a commit-
  tee, taken in an open meeting pursuant to a motion identifying the  general
  area  or areas of the subject or subjects to be considered, a committee may
  conduct an executive session of which only members of  such  committee  are
  present  for  the  following enunciated purposes provided, however, that no
  action by formal vote shall be taken to appropriate public monies:
 
    (a) matters which will imperil the public safety if disclosed;
 
    (b) any matter which may disclose the identity of a law enforcement agent
  or informer;
 
    (c) information relating to current or  future  investigation  or  prose-
  cution  of a criminal offense which would imperil effective law enforcement
  if disclosed;
 
    (d) discussions regarding proposed, pending or current litigation;
 
    (e) collective negotiations pursuant to article  fourteen  of  the  Civil
  Service Law;
 
    (f)  the  medical,  financial, credit, character or employment history of
  any person or corporation, or matters leading to the  appointment,  employ-
  ment,  promotion, demotion, discipline, suspension, dismissal or removal of
  any person or corporation;
 
    (g) the preparation, grading or administration of examinations; and
 
    (h) the proposed acquisition, sale or lease of real  property,  but  only
  when publicity would substantially affect the value of the property.
 
    (6)  Attendance  at an executive session shall be permitted to any member
  of the committee and any other persons authorized by the committee.
 
    b. (1) Minutes shall be taken at all open meetings  of  committees  which
  shall consist of a record or summary of all motions, proposals, resolutions
  and any other matter formally voted upon and the vote thereon.
 
    (2)  Minutes  shall  be taken at executive sessions of any action that is
  taken by formal vote which shall consist of a  record  or  summary  of  the
  final  determination  of  such  action, and the date and vote thereon; pro-
 
 
  vided, however, that such summary shall not include any matter which is not
  required to be made public by "the freedom of information law" as added  by
  Article six of the Public Officers Law.
 
    (3)  Minutes of meetings of all committees shall be available to the pub-
  lic in accordance with the provisions of Article six of the Public Officers
  Law, "the freedom of information law", and at such time and place  as  pre-
  scribed  by  the  Temporary  President, provided, however, that minutes for
  executive session meetings shall be available to the public within one week
  from the date of such executive session.
 
    c. The provisions of this section except paragraph three  of  subdivision
  a, and subdivision b shall not apply to the Committee on Rules.
 
    d.  Committee  presentations.  The chair of a committee may invite inter-
  ested persons to offer a presentation for a given amount of time on a  bill
  on  the  meeting  agenda with notice provided to the ranking member no less
  than 72 hours in advance. Where a committee chair makes such an invitation,
  the ranking member shall be afforded an equal number of  speakers  who  may
  speak for an equal amount of time. In addition, the ranker, without consent
  of  the  chair,  shall  be  able to schedule 3 committee presentations with
  notice provided to the chair at least 72 hours in advance. The chair  shall
  be  afforded  an equal number of speakers who may speak for an equal amount
  of time.
 
    e. Motion for committee consideration. No motion for committee  consider-
  ation  shall  be in order after the first Monday in May. The sponsor of any
  bill may file, through the Journal Clerk, a motion for committee  consider-
  ation  forty-five  days after the bill has been referred to such committee.
  Once a motion for committee consideration is filed, the chair of  the  com-
  mittee  shall  place  the bill on a committee agenda and schedule a vote on
  the bill within forty-five days. In the case of a bill that is referred  to
  a  standing committee having secondary reference, the bill shall be consid-
  ered within the next two committee meetings.
 
    ß 4. Hearings. a. Committee hearings. Chairs of standing  committees  may
  call  public hearings to permit interested persons, groups or organizations
  the opportunity to testify orally or in writing on  legislation  or  issues
  pending  before such standing committee. Chairs are encouraged to hold pub-
  lic hearings on legislation of important public interest, where, outside of
  the budget, significant public money is allocated, broad conduct  is  regu-
  lated  or  where the proposal has a broad public impact. Chairs may request
  that the Official Stenographer make a stenographic record of a public hear-
  ing. Official hearings may be conducted in accordance with procedure estab-
  lished by law. No committee may take testimony at a hearing unless at least
  two of its members are present at such hearing. Prior notice of all  public
  hearings shall be filed by the chair or his or her designee with The Legis-
  lative Bill Drafting Commission and the Temporary President and such notice
  shall contain information as to subject matter, date and place.
 
    b. Public forums. Notwithstanding the public hearings conducted by stand-
  ing committees, any Senator may convene a public forum on proposed or pend-
  ing legislation within the jurisdiction of a committee upon which he or she
  is  a  member, provided that any charge incurred attendant to such forum be
 
 
  borne by said Senator or his or her party conference.  Prior notice of such
  forum shall be filed with the chair of the committee.
 
    c.  Committee  oversight function. Each standing committee is required to
  conduct oversight of the administration of laws and  programs  by  agencies
  within its jurisdiction.
 
    d.  Each standing committee is required to file with the secretary of the
  senate an annual report, detailing its  legislative  and  oversight  activ-
  ities. Such report shall be posted to the Senate web site.
 
    e. Petition for a public hearing on a bill. By a petition of one-third of
  the members assigned to a committee rounded up to the nearest whole number,
  a  public  hearing shall be scheduled on a specific bill or number of bills
  within the jurisdiction of a committee, unless the majority of  members  of
  the  committee  reject  such petition. Such petitions shall be submitted to
  the clerk of the committee for presentation at the next committee  meeting.
  Public hearings scheduled by petition will be held at least 14 days follow-
  ing the committee meeting at which it was considered.
 
    f.  Hearings  of  standing  committees shall be video recorded and to the
  extent practicable webcast live. Video of such hearing shall be  posted  to
  the Senate web site within 24 hours.
 
    ß 5. Reports. a. No committee shall vote to report a bill or other matter
  unless  a majority of all the members thereof vote in favor of such report.
  Each report of a committee upon a bill shall have the vote of each  Senator
  attached  thereto  and  such  report and vote shall be available for public
  inspection. A member's vote on any matter before  the  committee  shall  be
  entered  by  the  member on a signed official voting sheet delivered to the
  Committee Chair.
 
    Any standing committee having secondary subject matter jurisdiction  over
  a bill may request the chair of the committee having primary subject matter
  jurisdiction  over said bill (which is the committee to which the said bill
  has been referred by the Temporary President pursuant to Rule VI) to commit
  the bill to the committee with secondary subject matter jurisdiction either
  when the bill is still in the  primary  committee  or  after  it  has  been
  reported  to  the  calendar.  If the chair of the primary committee refuses
  said request, then the committee having secondary jurisdiction, through its
  chair, may request the Temporary President to consider such secondary  ref-
  erencing.  If  a  secondary  reference  is so made, the secondary committee
  shall consider the bill forthwith and return said bill to the primary  com-
  mittee  or  the calendar, as the case may be, along with the secondary com-
  mittee's recommendations.
 
    Any bill which is referred to a standing committee other than the Commit-
  tee on Commerce, Economic Development and Small Business and which  imposes
  or  changes any reporting requirements or mandates on businesses or relates
  to the procedure by which  such  reporting  requirements  or  mandates  are
  imposed  or  changed,  shall, if favorably reported by the committee having
  original jurisdiction, be referred to the Committee on  Commerce,  Economic
  Development and Small Business for the purpose of reviewing and considering
  the  economic impact of the provisions of such bill. In the event that such
  a bill is not referred to the Committee on Commerce,  Economic  Development
 
 
  and  Small  Business  the  chairperson  of  such Committee may require such
  referral, subject to the approval of the Temporary President or his  desig-
  nees.
 
    All  committee  reports,  after  the second Friday in June, shall be made
  directly to the Committee on Rules. Notwithstanding any provision  of  Rule
  VI,  the Committee on Rules shall have the authority to introduce and refer
  bills to itself and shall also have the authority to refer  to  itself  any
  bill from any standing committee.
 
    Every  report of a committee upon a bill which shall not be considered at
  the time of making the same, or laid on the table by a vote of the  Senate,
  shall  stand  upon  the calendar in the order of first report with the bill
  and be entered upon the journal.
 
    b. Each bill reported by a standing committee shall be accompanied  by  a
  report,  and  the  minority  shall  file a minority committee report within
  seven days of the bill being reported out of  committee  and  said  reports
  shall  be  filed with the journal clerk. The report of a committee upon any
  matter referred to it shall upon request include a brief statement  of  the
  opinion  of  any  member  or  members of the committee voting in either the
  majority or minority.
 
    c. Where a "home rule" request is required as provided in any section  of
  Article  IX  of the Constitution, such request, certificate or message must
  be filed with the Journal Clerk of the Senate before final passage of  such
  bill.
 
    d.  Where a message of necessity is received from the Governor, such mes-
  sage shall be filed with the Journal Clerk of the Senate upon final passage
  of the bill.
 
    ß 6. Nominations. Unless the Senate  orders  otherwise,  all  nominations
  sent  by the Governor for the appointment of any officer shall be submitted
  to the Temporary President who shall then refer such nominations simultane-
  ously to the Finance Committee, and the appropriate standing committee, for
  consideration and recommendation and such standing committees,  other  than
  the  Committee  on Judiciary shall thereafter refer such nominations to the
  Finance Committee of the Senate who shall take whatever further actions  it
  deems  necessary  and  thereafter make its report on the nominations to the
  full Senate. Any Senator may submit a request to the Chair  of  a  Standing
  Committee  considering  a nomination, to speak before the committee for not
  more than five minutes on the nomination. The granting of any such  request
  shall  be at the sole discretion of the Committee Chair. A nomination shall
  not be confirmed without reference on the  day  on  which  it  is  received
  except  by  unanimous  consent. The names of those who voted for or against
  the nomination may be entered alphabetically on the journal,  if  any  five
  Senators request it.
 
    ß  7.  Finance Committee. A bill or resolution providing for an appropri-
  ation or creating or increasing a charge upon  the  State  Treasury  shall,
  when  reported  by  any  committee  other  than  the  Finance Committee, be
  referred to the Finance Committee, and the committee reporting such bill or
  resolution shall, at the time of making such report, recommend the  further
  reference thereof to the Finance Committee. At the request of the Temporary
 
 
  President  or  the  Chair of the Finance Committee, any such bill or resol-
  ution shall, at any time before final reading or adoption, be  referred  to
  the  Finance  Committee, which may consider and report upon any features in
  the bill or resolution creating or increasing such charge.
 
    The  sponsor  of  a  bill  providing for an increase or decrease in state
  revenues or in the appropriation or expenditure of  state  moneys,  without
  stating  the  amount  thereof,  must, before such bill is reported from the
  Finance Committee or other committee  to  which  referred,  file  with  the
  Finance Committee and such other committee a fiscal note which shall state,
  so far as possible, the amount in dollars whereby such state moneys, reven-
  ues or appropriations would be affected by such bill, together with a simi-
  lar  estimate,  if  the  same is possible, for future fiscal years. Such an
  estimate must be secured by the sponsor from the Division of the Budget  or
  the  department  or  agency  of  state  government  charged with the fiscal
  duties, functions or powers provided in such bill  and  the  name  of  such
  department or agency must be stated in such note.
 
    The Finance Committee shall keep and maintain a file containing all bills
  requiring  fiscal  notes and the notes appertaining thereto, which shall be
  available to Senators and officers  of  the  Senate,  accredited  represen-
  tatives  of  the  press,  and other responsible persons having a legitimate
  interest therein.
 
 
                                   RULE VIII
 
  PASSAGE OF BILLS
 
    Section  1.  Bills on desks. No bill shall be passed unless it shall have
  been printed and upon the desk of each Senator in its final form  at  least
  three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage, unless the Gov-
  ernor  or  acting  Governor shall have certified, under his or her hand and
  the seal of the State, the facts which in his or her opinion necessitate an
  immediate vote thereon, in which case it  must  nevertheless  be  upon  the
  desks  of  all  Senators in final form, not necessarily printed, before its
  final passage. No bill shall be passed pursuant to a message  of  necessity
  unless a majority of the Senators vote to approve the use of such message.
 
    ß  2. Reading of bills. a. Every bill shall receive three readings previ-
  ous to its being passed.
 
    b. Upon the third reading of a bill, the question upon its final  passage
  shall be taken immediately thereafter; provided, however, that any bill may
  be committed prior to the final reading thereof.
 
    ß  3.  Third  reading  calendar. a. The Calendar of bills on the order of
  third reading shall consist of all bills which  have  been  advanced  to  a
  third  reading  from  the  order  of  second report or the order of special
  report.
 
    b. All Senate bills, when advanced to a third reading shall  be  referred
  automatically  to the Jacketing Clerk, who shall cause each such bill to be
  readied for final passage in the same form as the last printed copy  there-
  of.  All  such  bills  shall  be jacketed with the proper jurat for certif-
  ication of final passage attached.
 
    ß 4. Amendments. a. A non-sponsor may move to amend a bill  at  any  time
  prior  to  the  completion  of its third reading provided that at least two
  hours before the time for the Senate to convene, a  copy  of  the  proposed
  amendment  or  amendments  to  any bill on the list of bills compiled under
  subdivision a of section six of this Rule has been served upon the  sponsor
  of the bill, and filed with the Journal Clerk. If a sponsor does not accept
  such  amendment,  the question shall be put to the house whether a majority
  of members elected vote in favor of the non-sponsor motion  to  amend,  and
  such  motion  shall pass only if a majority of members elected vote aye. If
  the sponsor accepts the amendment,  such  amended  bill  shall  be  ordered
  printed  without  a vote, debate or explanation, and such bill shall retain
  its place on the Third Reading Calendar.
 
    b. If a majority of members elected vote  in  favor  of  the  non-sponsor
  motion  to  amend,  the  sponsor  of the bill may make a motion to withdraw
  their name from sponsorship to be substituted by a co-sponsor or  the  Sen-
  ator who moved to amend the bill.
 
    c.  The  introducer of any calendar bill may offer an amendment or amend-
  ments to such bill and such amendment or amendments shall be  accepted  and
  the  bill  ordered printed without a vote, debate or explanation, provided,
  however, that in such case such bill may be recommitted by the chair of the
 
 
  standing committee that reported such bill and such recommittal shall  also
  be without a vote, debate or explanation.
 
    ß  5.  Substitution. When a bill is received as a message from the Assem-
  bly, or at any time thereafter, and a Senate bill, identical therewith,  is
  on  the  order of third reading, or in the order of first or second report,
  the Assembly bill may be substituted for the Senate bill upon a vote  of  a
  majority  of  the  Senate. A motion for such substitution shall be in order
  under the order of business of messages  from  the  Assembly,  motions  and
  resolutions, or the order of business in which the Senate bill is.
 
    ß 6. Final passage. a. Prior to the reading of the third reading calendar
  of  any  given day, the Temporary President may file with the Journal Clerk
  an active list of bills on the third reading calendar which  may  be  acted
  upon  on that date and he or she may lay aside any bill upon which no final
  action may be taken, provided however, that no bill shall be so laid  aside
  for  a  period  exceeding  five calendar legislative days. Such active list
  shall be published by 8 p.m. the previous evening or within two hours  fol-
  lowing the end of the previous days' session, whichever is later.
 
    b.  The  question on the final passage of every bill shall be taken imme-
  diately after the third reading and without debate. On the final passage of
  every bill and concurrent resolution a fast roll call shall be taken by the
  Secretary calling the names of five Senators, two of whom shall be the Tem-
  porary President and the Minority Leader provided, however, that each  Sen-
  ator's  name  shall be called on a slow roll call if requested by five Sen-
  ators. Each roll call, including the names of the Senators who were  absent
  shall  be  entered  on the journal. Upon each roll call vote, the Secretary
  shall announce the names of the Senators voting in  the  negative  and  the
  names  of  the Senators who were absent. Such roll calls shall be available
  for public inspection upon request in the office of the Journal Clerk. When
  a bill or concurrent resolution  does  not  receive  the  number  of  votes
  required  by the Constitution to pass it, it shall be declared lost, except
  in cases provided for by subdivision d of section two of Rule IX hereof.
 
    ß 7. Starred bills. a. A bill appearing on the calendar may be  "starred"
  only  by  or  on  behalf of the introducer, whereupon all further action on
  such bill shall be suspended, although it retains its place on  the  Calen-
  dar.
 
    b.  Other than for the purpose of amendment or recommittal, no action may
  be taken on a bill from which a star has been removed until one  day  after
  such removal.
 
    ß  8.  Recall  and concurrence. All Senate bills amended by the Assembly,
  and returned to the Senate, for its concurrence, and all bills  amended  by
  the report of a conference committee, shall be subject to the provisions of
  section one of this Rule.
 
    ß 9. Transmittal of bills to the Governor. All Senate bills passed by the
  Senate  and  sent to the Assembly for action shall, upon passage and return
  by the Assembly to the Senate, be transmitted by the Secretary to the  Gov-
  ernor  within  forty-five days after receipt from the Assembly; except that
  upon the filing of a request to hold such bill with the  Secretary  by  the
  sponsor  of the bill, the bill shall be held until such time as the sponsor
 
 
  rescinds the request to hold the bill and upon such rescission  the  Secre-
  tary shall transmit the bill to the Governor within seven days.
 
 
                                    RULE IX
 
  SENATORS
 
    Section  1. Attendance and vote. a. Every Senator shall be present within
  the Senate Chamber during the sessions of the Senate, unless  duly  excused
  or  necessarily prevented, and shall vote on each question for which a vote
  is required stated from the Chair unless excused by the Senate,  or  unless
  he  or she has a direct personal or pecuniary interest in the event of such
  question. If any Senator refuses to vote, unless he or she  be  excused  by
  the Senate, or unless he or she be interested, such refusal shall be deemed
  a  contempt.  In  order  to vote on a bill on the controversial calendar, a
  Senator, other than the Temporary President or  Minority  Leader,  must  be
  present  in  the Senate chamber and vote from his or her regularly assigned
  seat, except that a Senator acting as the Presiding Officer, Temporary Pre-
  sident or Minority Leader may vote from the place assigned to such officer.
  No Senator absent from a roll call vote shall be allowed to  vote  thereon;
  however, within the same day, a Senator required to attend a public hearing
  or other meeting of a standing or conference committee, which the Temporary
  President  has  designated  as appropriate, may cast his or her vote at any
  time prior to 5:00 P.M. or the adjournment of the Senate,  whichever  shall
  be later.
 
    b.  A Senator desiring to be excused from voting for a direct personal or
  pecuniary interest in the issue then before the Senate may, when his or her
  name is called, state such desire and if there be an objection make a brief
  statement, not occupying over two minutes, of the reasons for  making  such
  request,  and the question on excusing him or her shall then be taken with-
  out debate and shall be granted by the consent of two-thirds  of  the  Sen-
  ators  present;  and any Senator desiring to explain his or her vote upon a
  bill, may, when his or her name is called, be allowed a like opportunity.
 
    ß 2. Quorum. a. A majority of all the Senators elected shall constitute a
  quorum to do business. In case a less number than a quorum  of  the  Senate
  shall  convene,  those present are authorized to send the Sergeant at Arms,
  or any other person, for the absent Senators.
 
    b. The assent of two-thirds of the Senators elected shall be requisite to
  every bill appropriating the public moneys or property for local or private
  purposes, and to the passage of bills returned by the Governor without  his
  or her approval.
 
    c. On the final passage of any bill which imposes, continues or revives a
  tax, or creates a debt or charge, or makes, continues or revives any appro-
  priation  of  public or trust money or property, or releases, discharges or
  commutes any claim or demand of the State, three-fifths of all the  members
  elected to the Senate shall be necessary to constitute a quorum therein.
 
    d.  If,  on  taking  the final question on a bill, it shall appear that a
  constitutional quorum is not present, or if the bill  requires  a  vote  of
  two-thirds of all the Senators elected to pass it, and it appears that such
  number  is not present, the bill shall retain its place on the Calendar and
  be again taken up in its regular order.
 
 
    e. When any bill requiring the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senators,
  or a quorum of three-fifths thereof, is under consideration,  such  concur-
  rence  or  quorum, as the case may be, shall not be requisite except on the
  question of its final passage.
 
    f.  If  at  any time during the session of the Senate a question shall be
  raised by any Senator as to the presence of a quorum, the Presiding Officer
  shall forthwith direct the Secretary to call the roll, and  shall  announce
  the  result,  and  such  proceeding shall be without debate; but no Senator
  while speaking shall be interrupted by any other Senator raising the  ques-
  tion of a lack of a quorum, and the question as to the presence of a quorum
  shall not be raised more often than once in every hour unless the lack of a
  quorum shall be disclosed upon a roll call of the ayes and nays.
 
    g.  Whenever  upon  a  roll call any Senator who is upon the floor of the
  Senate Chamber refuses to make response when his or her name is called,  it
  shall  be  the  duty  of  the Presiding Officer, either upon his or her own
  motion or upon the suggestion of any Senator, to  request  the  Senator  so
  remaining  silent  to respond to his or her name, and if such Senator fails
  to do so, the fact of such request and refusal  shall  be  entered  in  the
  journal,  and  such  Senator shall be counted as present for the purpose of
  constituting a quorum.
 
    ß 3. Debate. a. Debate shall only be in order when it is germane  to  the
  question under discussion.
 
    b.  If the question in debate contains several points, a Senator may have
  the same divided, provided the division  called  for  embodies  a  distinct
  principle or statement of fact.
 
    c.  When  any  bill,  resolution  or motion is under consideration and it
  appears that no Senator desires to be heard further, the Presiding  Officer
  shall  put  the question: "Does any Senator desire to be heard further?" If
  no Senator shall rise to debate, the Presiding Officer  shall  declare  the
  debate  closed;  except that thereafter the Minority Leader may speak once,
  or may yield the floor to any Senator who may speak once, and may  be  fol-
  lowed  by the Temporary President who may also speak once, or may yield the
  floor to any Senator who may speak once.  The main question shall  then  be
  put immediately.
 
    d.  Debate  on  motions  or resolutions other than concurrent resolutions
  shall be limited to one hour with one-half hour allocated to  each  confer-
  ence.  Debate  upon  any  bill or concurrent resolution shall be limited to
  four hours, which shall include sufficient time for all Senators to explain
  their votes. No single Senator shall debate any bill or  concurrent  resol-
  ution  for more than thirty minutes. When any bill or concurrent resolution
  shall have been under consideration for two hours, including all amendments
  thereto, it shall be in order for any Senator to move to close debate,  and
  the  Presiding  Officer shall recognize the Senator who wishes to make such
  motion. Such motion to close debate shall not be amendable or debatable and
  shall be immediately put, and if it shall receive the affirmative vote of a
  majority of the Senators present, the pending measure shall take precedence
  over all other business.
 
 
    e. The vote shall thereupon be taken upon such bill, resolution or motion
  with such amendments as may be pending at the time of such motion,  accord-
  ing  to  the  Rules  of the Senate, but without further debate, except that
  upon the roll call any Senator may speak  not  to  exceed  two  minutes  in
  explanation  of his or her vote. After such motion to close debate has been
  made by any Senator, no other motion shall be in order  until  such  motion
  has been voted upon by the Senate.
 
    f.  After  the  Senate  shall have adopted the motion to close debate, as
  hereinbefore provided, no motion shall  be  in  order  but  one  motion  to
  adjourn  or  for  a  call  of  the Senate by the Temporary President, and a
  motion to commit. Should said motion to adjourn  be  carried,  the  measure
  under  consideration  shall  be  the pending question when the Senate shall
  again convene, and shall be taken up at the point where it was at the  time
  of  such adjournment. The motion to close debate may be ordered upon a sin-
  gle motion, a series of motions allowable under the rules, or an  amendment
  or  amendments,  or may be made to embrace all authorized motions or amend-
  ments, and include the  bill,  resolution  or  motion  to  its  passage  or
  rejection.  All  incidental  questions  of order, or motions pending at the
  time such motion is made to close debate, whether the same be on appeal  or
  otherwise, shall be decided without debate.
 
    ß  4. Order and decorum. a. Prior to the order of business, the presiding
  officer shall ask those in the chamber to rise and pledge allegiance to the
  flag. Those in attendance shall remain standing during the daily invocation
  and until asked to take their seats  by  the  presiding  officer.  Senators
  shall not interrupt the business of the Senate, or read any newspaper while
  the  journals or public papers are being read; or walk out of or across the
  Chamber when the Presiding Officer is putting a question; or when a Senator
  is speaking, pass between him or her and the Chair. Cellular telephones and
  audible pagers shall not be used in the Chamber or in the Senate Galleries.
  No sign, placard or prop shall be displayed, posted or carried in the Cham-
  ber.  Cellular telephones shall not be used in the lobby by members of  the
  general public. No person shall be introduced by a Senator during the regu-
  lar  business  of the Senate, except that it shall be permissible to intro-
  duce a person who has served as a member of the New York State  Legislature
  or  a person who is present in the Chamber for the purpose of nomination to
  an office to be confirmed by the Senate. On the nomination of any person to
  an office which is subject to the confirmation of  the  Senate,  nominating
  and seconding speeches shall be limited to fifteen minutes per conference.
 
    b.  Members  are  expected to uphold the highest standards of civility in
  dealing with other members. Debate should be dignified and lacking in  per-
  sonal  invective.  A Senator rising to debate or present a paper, to give a
  notice, to make a motion or report, shall address the Presiding Officer and
  shall not proceed further until recognized by the Chair; he  or  she  shall
  speak  on the same subject but twice the same day without leave of the Sen-
  ate; and when two or more Senators address the Chair, the Presiding Officer
  shall name the Senator who is first to speak.  A  Senator,  while  speaking
  after  recognition  by  the Chair, may, upon request of a Senator, yield to
  him or her temporarily without thereby relinquishing his or her prior right
  to the floor and, thereafter, may terminate such  interruption  and  resume
  speaking  at any time; provided, however, that it shall not be in order for
  a Senator to rise and request that a Senator, other than the one  with  the
  right  to  the  floor, yield to a question. Furthermore, it shall not be in
 
 
  order for a Senator, with the right to the floor, to ask another Senator to
  yield to a question, unless such Senator has previously spoken  during  the
  debate on the matter. All questions and responses shall be directed through
  the  chair,  and the presiding officer shall not be interrupted when speak-
  ing. After completion of the order of business for the day,  and  with  the
  unanimous  consent  of  the  Senate,  a  Senator  may make a statement, not
  exceeding fifteen minutes in length, concerning a  subject  or  matter  not
  pending before the Senate for consideration.
 
    c.  When  a Senator shall be called to order, he or she shall take his or
  her seat until the Presiding Officer shall have determined  whether  he  or
  she  is in order or not; and if decided to be out of order, he or she shall
  not proceed without the permission of the Senate;  and  every  question  of
  order  shall  be  decided by the Presiding Officer, subject to an appeal to
  the Senate by any Senator. It shall require an affirmative vote of a major-
  ity of all members elected to overrule a ruling of  the  Chair.  No  second
  appeal  shall be determined until the original appeal shall be decided; and
  if a Senator shall be called to order for words spoken, the words  excepted
  to shall be immediately taken down in writing.
 
    ß  5.  Presentation  of  papers.  a.  A  Senator presenting a paper shall
  endorse the same with his or her name and a brief written statement of  the
  subject of its contents.
 
    b.  When  the reading of a paper is called for, except petitions, and the
  same is objected to by any Senator, it shall be determined by a vote of the
  Senate, without debate.
 
    ß 6. Call of the Senate. For the purpose of securing  the  attendance  of
  Senators,  a  call  of the Senate may be ordered at any time, but such call
  shall not be in order after the voting on any question has begun, nor after
  the third reading of a bill has been completed, nor  after  the  motion  to
  close  debate  has  been  ordered  pursuant  to section three of this Rule,
  unless it shall appear upon an actual count by the Presiding Officer that a
  quorum is not present.
 
    ß 7. Absences. In all cases of absence of Senators during the sessions of
  the Senate, the Temporary President or a majority of the  Senators  elected
  may take such measures as they deem necessary to secure the presence of the
  absentees,  and  in  addition to suspension for a given period, may inflict
  such censure or penalty as they may deem just on those who shall not render
  sufficient excuse for their absence.
 
    ß 8. Staffing. All Senators shall receive the  same  base  allocation  of
  funds  for  staffing their offices. Additional funding for responsibilities
  associated with committees and  leadership  positions  shall  be  allocated
  within  amounts  available for committee and leadership staff; such amounts
  shall include, at a minimum, a budget sufficient to appoint a staff  member
  with  expertise  in  the  committee's subject matter.   The funding for the
  minority conference central staff shall not be less than thirty-three  per-
  cent of the funds allocated for all central staff.
 
    ß 9. Resources. All Senators shall have equitable access to the resources
  of  the  Senate,  including,  but not limited to, office supplies, communi-
  cations and audio visual resources, mail privileges  subject  to  published
 
 
  guidelines,  technology,  including  both  hardware and software, and equal
  access to the Legislative Bill Drafting Commission's Legislative  Retrieval
  System.
 
    ß  10.  District  Offices.  All Senators will receive funds to maintain a
  district office. Rents of district offices shall be based on a cost formula
  of office rental costs of an equal class of commercial office  space  based
  on  the  prevailing rent in the community where the Senator chooses to have
  his or her district office. A Senator whose district has geographic dispar-
  ities such that traversing the district is a hardship for his or  her  con-
  stituents,  as determined by the Temporary President, shall receive supple-
  mental funding to maintain a satellite office.
 
    ß 11. Allocation for Community Projects. Each conference shall receive an
  allocation from any amounts to be awarded by the Senate for community  pro-
  jects,  capital spending, local assistance or other similar allocations for
  member driven initiatives. The Majority shall receive  two-thirds  of  such
  funds  and the Minority shall receive one-third of the such funds; provided
  however that such proportions shall increase or  decrease  to  reflect  any
  changes in the membership of each conference.

  receives compensation from any public or  private  source  for  influencing
  legislation.
 
    i.  During  the  sessions  of  the Senate, no person other than a Senator
  shall occupy the chair of a Senator, or stand in or  otherwise  occupy  any
  part  of  the area between the last row of Senators' chairs on the east and
  west sides of the Chamber, and the east and west walls thereof, respective-
  ly. All persons in the Senate Chamber shall observe proper rules  of  order

  posed amendment, suspension, or rescission, shall be introduced to the Com-
  mittee  on  Rules  and  reported therefrom to the Senate floor.  Passing of
  such rules change shall require an affirmative vote of the majority of  all
  Senators elected.

    Section  1. Requirement of Fiscal Impact Notes. Fiscal impact notes shall
  be required for all bills and amendments, other than those excepted as pro-
  vided in section four hereof, which would substantially affect the revenues
  or expenses, or both, of any county, city, town, village,  school  district
  or  special district (hereinafter referred to as "political subdivisions").
  For purposes of this Joint Rule and section 51 of the Legislative Law,  the

  shall be estimated on the basis of any one or more of the following:
 
    (i) Individual political subdivisions; or
 
    (ii) Aggregates of political subdivisions  (a)  statewide  or  by  lesser
  geographic  area, or (b) by classification or subclassification of relevant
  characteristics; or
 
    (iii) Representative political subdivisions with relevant characteristics
  thereof quantitatively set forth, e.g., population, area, weighted  average
  daily attendance of pupils; or
 
    (iv)  Any  other  appropriate, convenient or accessible grouping of poli-
  tical subdivisions.
 
    B. Units of measurement. Fiscal impact  measurements  shall  be  made  in
  units  of  money,  personal  services, equipment, or any other appropriate,
  convenient or accessible units of measurement.
 
    C. Negligible Impact. A fiscal impact note filed by the sponsor of a bill
  which states that the fiscal impact of the  bill  is  negligible  shall  be
  deemed to be in compliance with this Joint Rule.
 
    ß  3.  Procedure.  A.  (i)  The Temporary President of the Senate and the
  Speaker of the Assembly shall each designate a  person  in  such  officer's
  respective  house to examine each bill in such house, without regard to its
  house of origin, for the purpose of ascertaining whether  a  fiscal  impact
  note is required pursuant to this Joint Rule, and if such note is required,
  such person shall so notify the sponsor of such bill.
 
    (ii)  The sponsor of such bill shall provide such fiscal impact note on a
  separate form prescribed therefor by the Temporary President of the  Senate
  and the Speaker of the Assembly jointly.
 
 
    (iii)  Such  fiscal impact note shall state the source thereof, which may
  be the sponsor; provided, however, that in the case of a bill proposed by a
  state department or agency, such note shall be prepared  and  furnished  by
  such department or agency.
 
    (iv)  Such  designated  person  in each house shall thereupon review each
  fiscal impact note for compliance with the provisions of this Joint Rule.
 
    B. No bill requiring a fiscal impact note shall be reported to the  floor
  of  the house unless accompanied by the appropriate note for the version of
  such bill so reported, except as provided in section four hereof.
 
    C. If an amendment to a bill has a fiscal  impact,  the  member  offering
  such amendment shall provide the fiscal impact note required by such amend-
  ment. If such amendment prevails, the sponsor shall provide a fiscal impact
  note for the amended bill before final passage, unless excepted pursuant to
  subdivision F of section four hereof.
 
    ß 4. Exceptions. A fiscal impact note shall not be required for a bill:
 
    A. subject to the provisions of section 50 of the Legislative Law;
 
    B.  requested  by  a county, city, town or village in accordance with the
  provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (b) of section two of Article IX
  of the Constitution;
 
    C. which provides discretionary authority to a political subdivision;
 
    D. submitted pursuant to section 24 of the State Finance Law;
 
    E. reported to the floor of the House by the  Rules  Committee,  if  such
  committee,  in its discretion, determines that such action is in the public
  interest;
 
    F. which has been amended on the floor of either house,  where  a  fiscal
  impact  note  would  otherwise  have been required for such amended bill by
  this Joint Rule and section 51 of the Legislative  Law,  if  the  Temporary
  President  of  the  Senate or the Speaker of the Assembly, respectively, in
  such officer's discretion, determines that the amended bill may be acted on
  in such officer's house without such note; or
 
    G. which inadvertently passes the Legislature where a fiscal impact  note
  would otherwise have been required by this Joint Rule and section 51 of the
  Legislative Law.
 
    ß  5.  Effect  of Inaccuracy. If the estimate or estimates contained in a
  fiscal impact note are inaccurate, such inaccuracy shall not affect, impair
  or invalidate such bill.
 
    ß 6. Application. The provisions of this Joint Rule shall apply to  bills
  and  amendments  proposed  for introduction at the nineteen hundred eighty-
  five regular legislative session and permanently thereafter.
 
 
                                 JOINT RULE II
 
    Section 1. Committee on Conference. The Temporary President of the Senate
  and  the  Speaker  of the Assembly may jointly convene a Joint Committee on
  Conference to consider and report upon substantially similar but not  iden-
  tical  legislation that has passed each House of the Legislature. Such com-
  mittee shall be constituted by the filing of a  joint  certificate  by  the
  Temporary  President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly with the
  Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the Assembly, and shall consist of
  the same number of members from each House. Unless  otherwise  provided  in
  the  certificate,  there  shall be five members on such committee from each
  House to be appointed by the Temporary President of the  Senate  who  shall
  appoint  the  members  from  the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly who
  shall appoint the members from the Assembly;  provided,  however,  that  of
  each House's delegation at least one member shall represent the minority in
  each  House.  The  Temporary President of the Senate and the Speaker of the
  Assembly shall each appoint a co-chairperson of the committee and such  co-
  chairpersons  shall  convene and recess meetings of the committee. Meetings
  jointly convened by the co-chairpersons shall be subject to the  provisions
  of Article 7 of the Public Officers Law. The committee shall file a written
  report  setting  forth  the  joint  recommendations  of  a majority of each
  House's delegation with the Secretary of the Senate and the  Clerk  of  the
  Assembly  or  such  other committees or officers as may be set forth in the
  certificate and such report may include specific bill language  that  would
  implement  the  joint committee's recommendations. No report shall be filed
  except upon the affirmative vote of a  majority  of  the  members  of  each
  House's delegation on the committee.
 
 
                                 JOINT RULE III
 
    Section 1. Budget Consideration Schedule. In accordance with section 54-a
  of  the Legislative Law, within ten days of the submission of the budget by
  the Governor pursuant to article VII of  the  Constitution,  the  Temporary
  President  of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly shall promulgate a
  schedule of dates for considering and acting  upon  such  submission.  Such
  schedule  shall include the dates for those actions required to be taken by
  the legislature pursuant to section 53 of the Legislative  Law,  dates  for
  the  convening of a joint budget conference committee or committees as pro-
  vided herein, and a date by which such committee or committees shall  issue
  a final report or reports.
 
    ß  2.  Joint Budget Conference Committee. In accordance with section 54-a
  of the Legislative Law, within ten days of the submission of the budget  by
  the  Governor  pursuant  to  article VII of the Constitution, the Temporary
  President of the Senate and the  Speaker  of  the  Assembly  shall  jointly
  establish  a Joint Budget Conference Committee and, as they deem necessary,
  any number of subcommittees subordinate to  such  Joint  Budget  Conference
  Committee,  to  consider  and  reconcile  such  budget resolutions or bills
  passed by, or as may be passed by, the Senate and  Assembly.    Such  Joint
  Budget  Conference  Committee  shall  be  constituted and conducted as pre-
  scribed in Joint Rule II and shall file its written report in  accord  with
  the schedule established pursuant to section 1 of this rule.
 
 
                                 JOINT RULE IV
 
    Section  1.  Joint  Advisory  Board on Broadcast of State Government Pro-
  ceedings. The Temporary President of the Senate  and  the  Speaker  of  the
  Assembly  shall  convene  a bi-partisan, bi-cameral joint advisory board to
  oversee current and future broadcast of  New  York  State  Government  pro-
  ceedings.  This board shall consist of eight members of whom three shall be
  appointed by the Temporary President of the Senate, three members shall  be
  appointed  by the Speaker of the Assembly and one member shall be appointed
  by each of the minority leaders of each house.  The appointments  shall  be
  of members of the respective houses of the Legislature. The Temporary Pres-
  ident  of  the  Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly shall each appoint a
  co-chair of the board.
 
    ß 2. Duties of the Joint Advisory Board. The joint advisory  board  shall
  engage  in  such  activities  as it deems necessary for the preparation and
  formulation of a report to review the efficacy of current  programming  and
  explore  future  expansion  of  such  to include additional legislative and
  other governmental proceedings, as well as other related public policy  and
  educational  material.  The  report  shall include specific recommendations
  concerning the broadcast or webcast on the Internet of all legislative com-
  mittee meetings. On or before November 1, 2009, the report shall be submit-
  ted to the Temporary President of the Senate, the Speaker of the  Assembly,
  the Minority Leader of the Senate and the Minority Leader of the Assembly.
